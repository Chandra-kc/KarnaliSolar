  <h2>Our Aim and Mission</h2> 
<p class="par">
With an aim to reduce global warming (one of the biggest threats that the earth is facing today), we would like to extract electricity from renewable sources, for example, solar and wind. 
This would enable zero carbon emission while generating electricity to fulfill our daily energy consumption and protect our environment for our future generation. To combat global warming, we would like to install a PV plant in the Surkhet district of Nepal. 
You can read more information about Surkhet <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surkhet_District">here.</a> 
<br> <br>
The proposed site is located close to Uttarganga temple and Radio Nepal in Surkhet and is illustrated below. Moreover, the information about the project is presented <a href="project.html">here.</a>
